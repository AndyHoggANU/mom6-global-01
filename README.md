# Global MOM6 implementation

1/10Â° global model. MOM6-SIS2 coupled configuration,
forced at the surface by JRA55v13 RYF using ACCESS-OM2-01 topography
and restart files. . This repository
contains the model configurations, and the scripts required to
generate the input forcing.

This is the third version of this simulation, starting from WOA initial
conditions and using HYCOM1 vertical coordinates rather than ZSTAR..
